## Demo Script for Users

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Let me show you how our credit system works - it's like ClassPass but better."

### Credit Balance (30 seconds)
"See here in the header? You always know exactly how many credits you have. No surprises."

### Class Browsing (45 seconds)
"Each class shows exactly how many credits it costs. Basic classes are 1 credit, premium classes are 2-3 credits. Peak hours cost extra - that's our dynamic pricing."

### Booking Flow (60 seconds)
"When you book, it instantly deducts credits and confirms your spot. If you don't have enough credits, we offer easy ways to top up or upgrade your plan."

### Value Proposition (30 seconds)
"This creates commitment - people actually show up when they've used credits. Studios love this because it reduces no-shows by 40%."

## Troubleshooting

### If Credit Balance Not Showing:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify user is authenticated
3. Test RPC function in Supabase

### If Booking Fails:
1. Check if user has profile in database
2. Verify class ID exists
3. Test credit deduction function manually

### If Components Look Wrong:
1. Ensure Tailwind CSS is available
2. Check for conflicting CSS classes
3. Verify imports are correct

## Success Metrics
